You will have to add the two maven plugins to your IDE to get this to work now.
 It is easier to manage dependancies with Maven and much easier to implement Spring Security, that's why I converted. I wish I knew about it a couple of months ago
 it would have saved us some time. Might be a few days before I get everything back up and working again.
 So if it dosen't run for you don't worry. Also when you are running it you will have to do it through maven. I willl show you that in college.
